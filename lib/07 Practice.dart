/*
Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this 
list and makes a new list that has 
only the even elements of this list in it.*/
void main() {
  var a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 200, 8, 16];
  var result = a.where((element) => element.isEven).toList();
  print(result);
}
